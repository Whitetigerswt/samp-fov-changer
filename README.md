samp-fov-changer
================

Change FOV like in many FPS games, in SA-MP. I won't explain what FOV is, just google it. I'll be assuming you know what it is, and what it does.

Tested on:
Euro v1.0 (hoodlum crack) 

and

American v1.0 (not cracked)

How to change your FOV
-----------------
The mod will create fov.cfg in your GTA directory after first load. all that this file can contain is a number, which is your FOV. the default is 70. I'm personally using 100. Although you can have your FOV as high as you'd like, the game is really not playable at anything over 170, and there are noticeable bugs at around 120

Also you can use FOV's with decimals. example: 75.3 or 84.4444
