================

Change FOV like in many FPS games, in SA-MP. I won't explain what FOV is, just google it. I'll be assuming you know what it is, and what it does.


How to change your FOV
-----------------
The mod will create fov.cfg in your GTA directory after first load. all that this file can contain is a number, which is your FOV. the default is 70. I'm personally using 100. The game has some limits to what you can make your FOV, since San Andreas was not designed so you could change your FOV. problems for this start to occur around 120.

Before and After
